# Extended SP3 security-delta results

**Status: implementation and evidence collection prepared; independent experimental outcomes pending.**

The preregistered hypotheses and predicted results are in
[`docs/SP3_SECURITY_DELTA_PLAN.md`](docs/SP3_SECURITY_DELTA_PLAN.md).
They are not observations. The earlier 50/50 memcached gate is a starting
correctness baseline, not a substitute for the new fault experiments.

The dedicated GitHub Actions workflow `sp3-security-delta` builds the H1 and
H2 comparators, collects raw outcomes, reruns the 50-case correctness gate
after each memcached scenario, independently checks recorded hashes, and
writes a generated results report into each evidence artifact. Its fault and
sanitizer binaries must never contribute to performance numbers.

| Question | Boundary | Comparator |
| --- | --- | --- |
| H1, U-domain | memcached/bipbuffer | Fault-only RLBox versus Extended SP3, with matched-content control |
| H1, U-domain | rsync/popt | Fault-only RLBox versus Extended SP3 |
| H1, U-domain | nginx/libpcre8 | Fault-only RLBox versus Extended SP3 |
| H1, U-domain | yaml/libyaml | Fault-only RLBox versus Extended SP3 |
| H2, T-domain | memcached LRU | Upstream raw, domain-only, T-registered Extended SP3, one-use handle |
| H2, T-domain | libyaml read-handler | Real API with project-authored T-side corruption, domain-only versus Extended SP3 |

The libyaml driver uses `yaml_parser_set_input` and RLBox domain checks, but
the mutation is in project-authored T code. It is not evidence of an upstream
libyaml exploit or wasm2c malicious return path. The nginx/OpenSSL
`ex_data_ptr` case remains outside this implementation; this repository has
no corresponding wasm2c integration.

A rejection alone is not evidence of T harm prevented. Address-only tracking
cannot distinguish address reuse (ABA) without a token or another temporal
identity mechanism. Matching type/domain does not prove intended-object
identity without an authenticated expected base. Same-type substitution is a
documented limitation.

Until raw outcomes are collected and verified, neither hypothesis has been
confirmed. See [`docs/SP3_SECURITY_DELTA_IMPLEMENTATION.md`](docs/SP3_SECURITY_DELTA_IMPLEMENTATION.md)
for reproduction commands and limits. Do not update manuscript guarantees or
numerical claims from this placeholder.
